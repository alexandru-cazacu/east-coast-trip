## Info

This is a school project made by me and other 5 students at IIS Castelli. It was bootstrapped with Create React App.

A list of useful docs:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html);
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy);
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app);
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

I'm stil working on the back-end (in php). I will commit it as soon as possible.

## Installation

Just download [npm](https://nodejs.org) and install it. Clone the repo, go into the project folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. To start the live server run `npm start` and follow the istructions.
