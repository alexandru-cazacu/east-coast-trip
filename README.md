## Info

This is a school project made by me and other 5 students at IIS Castelli. It was bootstrapped with Create React App.

A list of useful docs:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html);
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy);
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app);
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

I'm stil working on the back-end (in php). I will commit it as soon as possible.
